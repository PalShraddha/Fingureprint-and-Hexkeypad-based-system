# Fingerprint-And-Hex-Keypad-Based-Attendance-System
An IoT-based biometric attendance system that will store attendance records.
It uses a dual security system to record attendance.
A biometric scan turns each fingerprint into a one-of-a-kind entry code that can only be used by the employee or the student to whom the fingerprint belongs.
If someone wants to act as an employee proxy or the student proxy, they can’t because their biometrics don’t match.
